# Chloe Therreau - Data Science and Analysis Portfolio

## Quick introduction 

Hello ! 
My name is Chloe Therreau. 

For almost 5 years, I have been immersed in data through my academic and professional career. It started during my PhD in particle physics (Nantes University) and continued as an R&D engineer in optical simulations.

After developing further my skill in data analysis thanks to an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon, I am now seeking new opportunities as a data scientist. 
I am looking forward to use my analytical skills, scientific background and enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making to contribute to the success of an innovative organization.

This portfolio regroups all the Data Science and Analysis projects I work on. It regroups projects for academic and self-learning purpose, for volunteer works or hobby purposes, highlighting my data abilities and skills.


## Projects
### 2023

HomeExchange is a popular alternative to Airbnb that enables house swapping. HomeExchange want to understand the reasons behind customer churn. 
In this project I have used SQL, Python, WebScrapping, Time series forecasting and classification algorithms to understand why users are not re-subscrite from the platform and provide some recommendation to HomeExchange.

Indoor and outdoor air quality data are generated by different stakeholders, on different geographical and temporal scales, and are therefore not linked easily, thus limiting the interpretations that can be made from indoor air measurements. The challenge was to connect indoor air measurements with outdoor air quality data to understand the correlation between indoor and outdoor air quality. I extracted outdoor air pollutions from simulations and linked them to buildings coordinates where indoor air quality measurement campaigns were conducted.

### 2020
<img align="left" width="160" height="160" src="illustrations/amas_ball.jpg"> **[Thesis work - Particle Physics](https://github.com/ctherreau/thesis_0vbb_simulation_clustering)** 

Unfortunately, I cannot share all the codes I have produced for my thesis due to confidentiality reasons. However, I can show you a very small part of my thesis work that specifically involves a clustering algorithm. This code is used for the implementation of Chapter 6.5.2 of my thesis, which you can read [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-02926324).
