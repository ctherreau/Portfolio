# Chloe Therreau - Data Science and Analysis Portfolio

## Quick introduction 

Hello ! 
My name is Chloe Therreau. 

For almost 5 years, I have been immersed in data through my academic and professional career. It started during my PhD in particle physics (Nantes University) and continued as an R&D engineer in optical simulations.

After developing further my skill in data analysis thanks to an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon, I am now seeking new opportunities as a data scientist. 
I am looking forward to use my analytical skills, scientific background and enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making to contribute to the success of an innovative organization.

HomeExchange is a popular alternative to Airbnb that enables house swapping. HomeExchange aims to understand the reasons behind customer churn. 
In this project I have used SQL, Python, WebScrapping, Time series forecasting and classification algorithms to understand why users are not re-subscrite from the platform and provide some recommendation to HomeExchange.
